#  **[62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)**

### *Description:*


    A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

    The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

    How many possible unique paths are there?


    Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

    Note: m and n will be at most 100.

    Example 1:

    Input: m = 3, n = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Right -> Down
    2. Right -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Right
    Example 2:

    Input: m = 7, n = 3
    Output: 28

        alist = [[ 0  for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

                if j > 0: alist[i][j] += alist[i][j - 1]
        return alist[m - 1][n - 1]
```
