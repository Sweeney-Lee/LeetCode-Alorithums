#  **[ 53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/ )**

### *Description:*

    Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

    Example:

    Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
    Follow up:

    If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0
        submax, result = nums[0], nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            submax = nums[i] if submax <= 0 else (submax + nums[i])
            result = max(result, submax)
        return result
