#  **[300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/ )**

### *Description:*
    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

    Example:

    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4 
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
    Note:

    There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
    Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
    Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?
