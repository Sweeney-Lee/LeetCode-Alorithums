#  **[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/ )**

### *Description:*

    Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Example 1:

    Input: "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3 
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
    Example 2:

    Input: "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    Example 3:

    Input: "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
                Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

                i = s[i: m].index(s[m]) + 1 + i
            maxL = max(maxL, m - i + 1)
        return maxL
