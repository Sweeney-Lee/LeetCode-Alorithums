### *Description:*
    Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

    Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

    Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

    Example 1:

    Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
    Output: 1.00000
    Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    Example 2:

    Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
    Output: 0.60000
    Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
    In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
    Example 3:

    Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
    Output: 0.73278
    Note:

    0 <= K <= N <= 10000
    1 <= W <= 10000
    Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

# conclude:
1. change d[x + 1] + d[x + 2] + ...d[x + W] to d[X] - d[W]
2. add the N in params to avoid judge
