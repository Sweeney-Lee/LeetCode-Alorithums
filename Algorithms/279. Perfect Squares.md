#  **[279. Perfect Squares]( https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/description/ )**

### *Description:*

        Given a positive integer n, find the least number of perfect square numbers (for example, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) which sum to n.
        
        Example 1:
        
        Input: n = 12
        Output: 3 
        Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
        Example 2:
        
        Input: n = 13
        Output: 2
        Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.

# Tips:
> In mathematics, Legendre's three-square theorem states that a natural number can be represented as the sum of three squares of integers

> { n=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2} } n=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}
> if and only if n is not of the form { n=4^{a}(8b+7) } n = 4^a(8b + 7) for integers a and b.

> The first numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares (i.e. numbers that can be expressed as {\displaystyle n=4^{a}(8b+7)} n = 4^a(8b + 7)) are

> 7, 15, 23, 28, 31, 39, 47, 55, 60, 63, 71 ...
